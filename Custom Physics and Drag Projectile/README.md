Custom physics calculations for non-rigid body objects, based on forces and accounts for drag and atmospheric conditions.

## Getting Started

It's a MEL script installation is pretty straight forward. 

### Prerequisites

```
Unity 2017.1
```

### Running the script

Add script to object in scene, or spawnable object. Calling AddForce(vector 3) allows to... add force to the object. PhysicsCoroutine() handles the physics calaculation.
