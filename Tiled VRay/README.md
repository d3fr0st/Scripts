# Linear Align 3D

Progressively recreating the 3ds max loop tools one of my artist has been missing in maya.

## Getting Started

It's a PyMel script installation is pretty straight forward. 

### Prerequisites

```
Built for Maya 2016
```

### Running the script

V-Ray Frame Buffer needs to be run once at desired resolution first, can be canceled as soon as resolution is set.

Running the script creates a window which lets you select X and Y Tiling, also has an offset parameter incase a render needs to be resumes from a certain point.
