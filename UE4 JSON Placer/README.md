# Linear Align 3D

Places objects in an unreal scene based on data from a JSON file. Plan to make a Maya and 3ds max script to automatically export objects and create said JSON file. Mostly just a quick prototype thrown together to evaluate workflow uses.

## Getting Started

Just run this through UE4.19's Python interface.

### Prerequisites

```
Unreal Engine 4.19
Unreal Studio Beta
```

### Running the script

```
Make sure to enable python script in the project.

Looks for example.json on the user's desktop
Assset path named in the json file is /Game/Assets/
```
